  abstract  = {Orientation estimation from magnetic, angular rate, and gravity (MARG) sensor array is a key problem in mechatronic-related applications. This paper proposes a new method in which a quaternion-based Kalman filter scheme is designed. The quaternion kinematic equation is employed as the process model. With our previous contributions, we establish the measurement model of attitude quaternion from accelerometer and magnetometer, which is later proved to be the fastest (computationally) one among representative attitude determination algorithms of such sensor combination. Variance analysis is later given enabling the optimal updating of the proposed filter. The algorithm is implemented on real-world hardware where experiments are carried out to reveal the advantages of the proposed method with respect to conventional ones. The proposed approach is also validated on an unmanned aerial vehicle during a real flight. Results show that the proposed one is faster than any other Kalman-based ones and even faster than some complementary ones while the attitude estimation accuracy is maintained.},

  abstract  = {Accelerometer-magnetometer attitude determination is a common and vital medium processing technique in industrial robotics and consumer electronics. In this paper, we report a novel analytic attitude solution to the accelerometer-magnetometer combination in the sense of Wahba’s problem. The Davenport matrix is analytically given and its eigenvalues are computed. Through derivations, the eigenvalues are simplified to very short expressions. Then, the corresponding eigenvectors are given accordingly via matrix row operations. The system is highly optimized based on the factorization and simplification of the obtained row-echelon form, which makes it computationally fast in practice. In this way, it is named as the fast accelerometer-magnetometer combination (FAMC). Experiments on the correctness and advantages of the proposed solution are conducted. The results show that compared with conventional solutions, the proposed analytic solution is not only correct and accurate, but to our knowledge, the most time efficient as well.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a quaternion-based Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for estimating the three-dimensional orientation of a rigid body. The EKF exploits the measurements from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) that is integrated with a tri-axial magnetic sensor. Magnetic disturbances and gyro bias errors are modeled and compensated by including them in the filter state vector. We employ the observability rank criterion based on Lie derivatives to verify the conditions under which the nonlinear system that describes the process of motion tracking by the IMU is observable, namely it may provide sufficient information for performing the estimation task with bounded estimation errors. The observability conditions are that the magnetic field, perturbed by first-order Gauss-Markov magnetic variations, and the gravity vector are not collinear and that the IMU is subject to some angular motions. Computer simulations and experimental testing are presented to evaluate the algorithm performance, including when the observability conditions are critical.},

Thus, it is important to have reliable methods to pass from one representation to the other. While passing from a quaternion to the corresponding rotation matrix is given by Euler-Rodrigues formula, the other way round can be performed in many different ways. Although all of them are algebraically equivalent, their numerical behavior can be quite different. In 1978, Shepperd proposed a method for computing the quaternion corresponding to a rotation matrix which is considered the most reliable method to date. Shepperd's method, thanks to a voting scheme between four possible solutions, always works far from formulation singularities. In this paper, we propose a new method which outperforms Shepperd's method without increasing the computational cost.},

  abstract  = {A planar rotation can be represented in several ways—for example, as an angle between 0 and 2π or as a unit complex number x + iy = cos θ + i sin θ. Planar rotations combine by summing their angles modulo 2π ; so one way to generate a uniform planar rotation is to generate a uniform angle. This chapter describes a uniformly distributed spatial rotation as one not having a uniformly distributed angle. For a unit quaternion, the ω component is the cosine of half the angle of rotation. When the angle is uniformly distributed between 0 and 2π, the average magnitude of ω will be 2/π 0.6366, which exceeds the correct value for a uniform rotation by a factor of 3/2. It is easy to generate random unit quaternions and, hence, rotations with the correct distribution. Pairs of independent variables with Gaussian distribution can easily be generated using the polar or Box–Muller method, which transforms a point uniformly distributed within the unit disk. The Gaussian generation can be folded into the unit quaternion generation to give an efficient algorithm.}

  abstract  = {Orientation estimation using low cost sensors is an important task for Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) in order to obtain a good feedback for the attitude controller. The challenges come from the low accuracy and noisy data of the MicroElectroMechanical System (MEMS) technology, which is the basis of modern, miniaturized inertial sensors. In this article, we describe a novel approach to obtain an estimation of the orientation in quaternion form from the observations of gravity and magnetic field. Our approach provides a quaternion estimation as the algebraic solution of a system from inertial/magnetic observations. We separate the problems of finding the “tilt” quaternion and the heading quaternion in two sub-parts of our system. This procedure is the key for avoiding the impact of the magnetic disturbances on the roll and pitch components of the orientation when the sensor is surrounded by unwanted magnetic flux. We demonstrate the validity of our method first analytically and then empirically using simulated data. We propose a novel complementary filter for MAVs that fuses together gyroscope data with accelerometer and magnetic field readings. The correction part of the filter is based on the method described above and works for both IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and MARG (Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity) sensors. We evaluate the effectiveness of the filter and show that it significantly outperforms other common methods, using publicly available datasets with ground-truth data recorded during a real flight experiment of a micro quadrotor helicopter.},

  abstract  = {The integration of the Accelerometer and Magnetometer (AM) provides continuous, stable and accurate attitude information for land-vehicle navigation without magnetic distortion and external acceleration. However, magnetic disturbance and linear acceleration strongly degrade the overall system performance. As an important complement, the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) produces the heading estimates, thus it can potentially benefit the AM system. Such a GNSS/AM system for attitude estimation is mathematically converted to a multi-observation vector pairs matching problem in this paper. The optimal and sub-optimal attitude determination and their time-varying recursive variants are all comprehensively investigated and discussed. The developed methods are named as the Optimal Linear Estimator of Quaternion (OLEQ), Suboptimal-OLEQ (SOLEQ) and Recursive-OLEQ (ROLEQ) for different application scenarios. The theory is established based on our previous contributions, and the multi-vector matrix multiplications are decomposed with the eigenvalue factorization. Some analytical results are proven and given, which provides the reader with a brand new viewpoint of the attitude determination and its evolution. With the derivations of the two-vector case, the n-vector case is then naturally formed. Simulations are carried out showing the advantages of the accuracy, robustness and time consumption of the proposed OLEQs, compared with representative methods. The algorithms are then implemented using the C++ programming language on the designed hardware with a GNSS module, three-axis accelerometer and three-axis magnetometer, giving an effective validation of them in real-world applications. The designed schemes have proven their fast speed and good accuracy in these verification scenarios.},
